# Conspiracy Theorist AI – DFDS Tech Moves Us 2023

## Overview

Ever wanted to debate with a digital conspiracy theorist? Well, you're in luck. This project is like a time machine, zapping you back to the '90s conspiracy goldmine from the Aminet archives, processed through the mysterious alchemy of a Node.js backend, and then brought to life in a React frontend that's been pumped with the sort of AI steroids that would make even Elon Musk's Truth AI blush.

### Backend: The Node.js Archive Whisperer

- **Document Retrieval System:** A Node.js-powered librarian, meticulously sifting through dusty digital archives of conspiracy theories.
- **Vector Database Magic:** Like a squirrel stashing nuts, our system hoards conspiracy-laden documents in a sleek vector database.

### Frontend: React to Conspiracies

- **Chatbot Alchemy:** Vercel AI SDK and Langchain have brewed a concoction that turns texts into a conspiracy theorist with an attitude, because why not?
- **ElevenLabs Vocal Chords:** Text-to-speech that's eerily human, turning typed conspiracy rants into something you can listen to for late-night chuckles.

## Musk-See Inspiration

Sure, Elon Musk mused about a Truth AI, but we're pretty sure even he'd double-take at our creation. Our AI is less about truth and more about giving you that tinfoil hat experience. So buckle up—things are about to get truth-adjacent.

## How to Engage with Your Very Own AI Conspiracy Theorist

- **Starting a Chat:** Simply say "Tell me about CIA coverups" and watch as the AI eagerly pulls you down the rabbit hole.
- **Listening to the Madness:** Hit play and let our ElevenLabs-powered AI serenade you with tales of cover-ups and crop circles.

## Contributing to the Madness

Fancy adding your own spin on what's 'true'? Follow the white rabbit:

1. Fork the repository (it's like stealing the declaration of independence, but legal).
2. Create your feature branch (name it something like `conspiracy-confirmed`).
3. Commit your changes (leave evidence, unlike Bigfoot).
4. Push to the branch (send that UFO to the mothership).
5. Submit a pull request (make sure to wear your tinfoil hat).

## A Shout Out to the Puppet Masters

- **Aminet Archive:** For not knowing they'd be the digital Library of Alexandria for conspiracy theories.
- **Langchain & Vercel AI SDK:** The AI behind the curtain.
- **ElevenLabs:** For giving our AI the gift of gab.
- **Elon's Musings:** For 'Truth AI'—a muse that unintentionally endorsed digital conspiracists.
